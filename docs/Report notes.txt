Using tab - had to read about tab and run in command line
 - Spacing needs working out
 - how to enter notes? strings or values?
 - Returning exit value? 

Ghostview to view files - https://www.ghostscript.com/releases/gsdnld.html

Looked at reading midi files in java - javax.sound.midi, sequence
Started by using one track midi files - could add multi-track functionality later

Problems: 
	Spacing in TAB
	Representing fretboard in code
